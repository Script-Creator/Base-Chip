# Base Chip
A little cheeky way to give people access to my E2s without them having to ask us for files all the time. I'll update this area to look more impressive in the near future.

## Function
This is an E2 that will give you full control to automatically open doors, trigger multiple alarms in specific areas, with the capability to change the type of alarm, hide individual alarms, set sounds for each alarm or for all alarms, and will have advanced targetting. It will also use a better encoder to save data which should make things easier for everyone involved.
